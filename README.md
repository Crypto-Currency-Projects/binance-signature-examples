# Binance API signature examples

[Binance API document](https://binance-docs.github.io/apidocs/spot/en/#signed-trade-user_data-and-margin-endpoint-security) has the details of how to hash the signature.
However we are still seeing users spending hours to find out why server still complains about bad signatures. In this repo, we give the example script on how to do signature.

## Should I look into this repo
- if you don't what's signature
- if you don't know how to do sha256 hashing in a language
- if your signature can't pass the server's validation

## Which language included
- Python
- and more
